# labeler

Adds record label to playlists.

Input playlist file must be in the format

    Artist,Song,Album
    Artist,Song,Album
    ...

Or with tab separators instead of commas if you give the `-t` option.

It reads from standard input by default and writes to dtandard output, or you may specify files:

    labeler [-t] [in [out]]
      -t   use tab separators rather than commas
      in   input file name, or - for for stdin
      out  output file name, or - for for stdout

It is very slow, using one search and two lookups in [Musicbrainz](http://musicbrainz.org/)
for each item.

Sometimes it canâ€™t find the item in Musicbrainz and sometimes Musicbrainz doesn't have the label
for the item.
